# #leapgest(ure)

Social media indexing protocol for non-monetary currency foundation. Index posts containing key words are submitted on [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) by trust anchors, good-doers in their respective communities, who provide their peers and themselves a foundation for capturing leaps in habits in between these timely checkpoints that leap seconds represent.

*Work in progress!*

Continue reading the following resource to install the current state of this project, or just to find out more about "react-boilerplate" (= out of the box disposition of some well-known Node.js modules):
[README.react-boilerplate.md](github.com/fairshift/lepagesta/edit/master/README.react-boilerplate.md)


**How-to install**


**0.** In short, to install one should have the following applications installed on their OS:

— [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

— [NPM - Node package manager](https://npmjs.com)
... and optionally, Git


**1.** After this is taken care of, this repository should be either downloaded (& unzipped) or cloned on local machine with "git clone https://github.com/fairshift/lepagesta.git" (see "Clone or download" menu on the right)


**2.** Open application folder in terminal and run the following commands in a sequence to install and run...

— npm install

— npm start

... and open [localhost:3000)(http://localhost:3000) in your browser


**Work in progress!** The following steps include...

— Installing connectors with social media and finishing auth(entication) implementation with [github.com/vmasto/express-babel](http://github.com/fairshift/express-babel) and [Firebase backup backend](firebase.com)

— Implementing parsers for extracting #leapgest protocol data captured on social media (and finishing the parser2db json schema mapping module, in the meanwhile)

— Fixing layout issues (currently it is a real wreck, as this shipping of code was not scheduled definitely and the code structure has seen much refactoring and last-minute implementations)

... for more features please see section "Features" in the app itself
